  					<h1>Jake Mitchell</h1>

  					<p> On February 9th, 1988, I was born in Pendleton, Oregon to my parents Jon, and Mindy Mitchell. I grew up just 15 miles south of there in a town called Pilot Rock with them, and my other 4 other siblings. Since living there, I have gone on a mission for the L.D.S. church in Russia, married my spouse in Twin Falls, Idaho, and currently reside with her in South Jordan, Utah.</p>

  					<p> I enjoy being outside, and being active. The winter months put a damper on most of the activities that I enjoy the most, especially softball. I am active in the L.D.S. church, and strive to live by it's teachings. I have a wonderful wife. If you look to your left, you'll see that I've got a pretty good eye... We enjoy being together and doing pretty much the same things. Sometimes, I'll have to go to a concert or a play, or she'll have to go to a football or basketball game.
